# Tableau--Citi-Bike-Analytics

This analysis uses Citi Bike 2021 data to create Tableau visualizations for user type/usage pattern/popular station phenomenon. Jupyter notebook is utilized to transform needed data. Detailed analysis as below: 

## Analysis
### Seasonality Analysis by user types:
Overall majority trips were made by members, the trip counts and mileage peak during summer, weekends and traffic rush hours. However, the usage pattern showed some difference between member vs. casual users. 
* Usage by month: both type of users rided more as weather got warmer and slowed down when weather got colder with lowest usage point in Feb. Casual users’ rides out passed members during summer (Jul/Aug/Sep).
* Usage by weekdays: member users had more consistent trips over the weekdays (and higher than casual users) and lower usage over the weekends, while casual users were the opposite, they made more trips over the weekends.
* Usage by hours: higher ride counts and miles were observed during rush hours for both type of users. However, casual users’ trips tend to start earlier and end later than member users.
The reason behind above differences is the purpose of renting bikes: casual users tend to ride during spare time while members had more routine needs- a lot of them rided to work on daily basis.
### Trip duration Analysis:
Despite the fact that trip counts and mileage were higher in summer, trip durations got lower throughout the year of 2021. One of the reasons was because Hoboken area (zip code 07030) launched bike sharing program in mid-year which made renting/returning bikes more convenient therefore increased the short term rides. This is proven by the fact that South Waterfront walkway and Hoboken Terminal became two of the most popular start stations in a short period of time.
### Popular station and Route Analysis:
The most popular start and end stations were as below as they are around either high density residential zones or critical traffic junctions for commuting to Manhattan.
* Grove St Path
* South Waterfront walkway
* Hoboken Terminal 
The most popular routes are as below with similar reasons: 
* Hoboken Terminal to Hoboken ave
* McGinley Square to Sip Ave (both ways)
* Martin Light Rail to Grove St Path
