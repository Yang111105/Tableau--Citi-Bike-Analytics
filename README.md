# Tableau--Citi-Bike-Analytics

This analysis uses Citi Bike 2021 data to create Tableau visualizations for user type/usage pattern/popular station phenomenon. Jupyter notebook is utilized to transform needed data. Detailed analysis as below: 

Analysis 
Seasonality Analysis by user types:
Overall majority trips were made by members, the trip counts and mileage peak during summer, weekends and traffic rush hours, however, the usage pattern showed some difference between member vs. casual users. 
* Usage by month: both type of users rides more as weather gets warmer and slows down when weather gets colder with lowest usage point Feb. Casual users’ rides out pass members during summer (Jul/Aug/Sep).
* Usage by weekdays: member users had more consistent trips over the weekdays (and higher than casual users) and lower usage over the weekends, while casual users were the opposite, they made more trips over the weekends.
* Usage by hours: higher rides count and miles were observed during rush hours for both type of users. However, casual users’ trips tend to start earlier and end later than member users.
The reason behind above differences is the purpose of renting bikes: casual users tend to ride during spare time while members have more routine needs- a lot of them ride to work on daily basis.
Trip duration Analysis:
Despite the fact that trip counts and mileage are higher in summer, trip durations got lower throughout the year of 2021. One of the reasons is because Hoboken area (zip code 07030) launched bike sharing program in mid-year which made rent/return bikes more convenient therefore increased more short term rides. This is proven by that South Waterfront walkway and Hoboken Terminal became two of the most popular start stations in a short period of time.
Popular station and Route Analysis:
The most popular start and end stations are as below as they are around high density residential zones and critical traffic junctions commuting to Manhattan.
* Grove St Path
* South Waterfront walkway
* Hoboken Terminal 
The most popular routes are as below with similar reasons: 
* Hoboken Terminal to Hoboken ave
* McGinley Square to Sip Ave (both ways)
* Martin Light Rail to Grove St Path
